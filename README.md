# Reservoir Water Level Forecasting

## Problem Statement
A multi-stacking ensemble based multi-variate time series analysis model using machine learning, deep learning and statistical procedures like Support Vector Regressor(SVR), XGBoost, Facebook Neural Prophet, Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) and Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) with near real time reservoir water level data, and associated hydro-meteorological data like rainfall, temperature etc. for better and accurate temporal water level forecasting.
